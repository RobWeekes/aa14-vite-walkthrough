# My React Vite Template

This repo template will help you generate a React app using Vite.

## How to clone

The command that you will run to clone the repo is this:

```sh
npx tiged <YOUR-GH-USERNAME>/my-react-vite-template#main <new-project-name>
```

(Substitute your GitHub username for `<YOUR-GH-USERNAME>`.)

This command will create a clone of the repo' `main` branch under the name
<new-project-name> in the directory where it is run.

## Initialize your Vite template

After cloning the repo, open the folder in your code editor using `code .`

In your VSCode (or equivalent) terminal, open the server folder and install dependencies:

```sh
cd my-react-vite-template
npm install
```

Then start your Vite server by running `npm run dev`

To convert the template into your own project, change these files:

```README, the `title` in __index.html__, and the `"name"` in __package.json__```

## README.md
A good README will typically explain

* The purpose of the code / repo
* How to download, clone, or otherwise access the codebase
* How to set up / install the project
* How to use the project
* How to contribute or make changes to the codebase
